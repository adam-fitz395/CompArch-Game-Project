# EASy68K Video Game Example
This repo contains a very basic example game made using [EASy68K][http://www.easy68k.com/] that was for a university project. The premise of the game is very simple, to see how long you can go before getting hit by an enemy (there is only one enemy that appears in the same position, but moves across the screen).
